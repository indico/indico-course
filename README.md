# Indico E-Learning Course

![](screenshot.png)

This tool builds Indico's e-learning documentation from the
[end-user documentation repo](https://github.com/indico/indico-user-docs), using the
[Adapt](https://www.adaptlearning.org/) framework. The end result is a SCORM package which can be imported into most
modern e-learning platforms. The latest SCORM package can be found in the
[Releases](https://github.com/indico/indico-course/releases) page.
