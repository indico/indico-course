          <img src="course/en/images/logo_indico.png" style="width: 400px; min-width: 0;">

          Indico is a general-purpose event management tool which provides event organizers with lots of tools to
          manage their events, as well as many other things.
          We can split Indico's feature set in three groups:

             * **Meeting Management** - a complete solution for agenda creation and sharing of material and
               video-conferencing resources;
             * **Conference Management** - feature-rich workflows which address the main tasks in Conference Management,
               from registration to peer reviewing and paper editing, as well as abstract submission and reviewing;
             * **Room Booking** - Indico includes a modern and highly-versatile Room Booking system;

          **CERN** is the main organization behind Indico and also the home of the biggest known Indico server, with
          [more than 700.000 events](https://indico.cern.ch/category/0/statistics) currently hosted in it.

          ### Open Source

          Indico is [**Open Source**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source), which means that its
          [source code](https://github.com/indico/indico) is available for anyone in the world to read, play with and
          improve. Anyone can set up their own Indico server, and that's exactly what more than 300 institutions world
          wide have done.

          Indico is used not only by the likes of Fermilab, BNL and SLAC - there now are instances spread across
          organizations as diverse as the United Nations, the GNOME Foundation and ECMWF. It is now a software
          project which transcends the borders of CERN and attracts the contributions of software developers world
          wide.

  quiz:
    - body: |
       Can you create a new category at the root (home page) of an Indico server?
      items:
        - text: "Yes, Indico categories are public"
        - text: "Yes, but only if you have permission to do so"
          correct: true
        - text: "No"
      correction: |
        That’s not right! One would have to click on the pencil icon in the toolbar next to the
        <strong>Create Event<strong> button first.
    - body: |
        Can a category be <em>less restricted</em> than its parent category?
      items:
        - text: "Yes"
          correct: true
        - text: "No"
      correction: |
        That’s not right! Unless the category protection is set as <strong>Inherited</strong>, a category can be less
        restricted than its parent category.
    - body: |
        Can an event within a category be <em>more restricted</em> than the category itself?
      items:
        - text: "Yes"
          correct: true
        - text: "No"
      correction: |
        That's not right! An event can be set as <strong>Protected</strong>, in which case it can be further restricted
        with regards to the enclosing category.
    - body: |
        Can an event within a category be non-accessible by the category managers?
      items:
        - text: "Yes"
        - text: "No"
          correct: true
      correction: |
        That’s not right! Events within a category are always accessible to category managers.
    - body: |
        How do I personalize my category (description text, logo, material...)?
      items:
        - text: I edit it myself
          correct: true
        - text: I open a support ticket on ServiceNow
      correction: |
        No need for that! Category managers can personalize their categories from the category management page, so you
        can do that yourself. Still do feel free to contact our support line if you have questions, however.

        - text: There are multiple contributions, speakers, minutes and materials.
          correct: true
      correction: |
        That’s not right! Events of every type can have restrictions.

        - text: Use your Outlook calendar instead
        - text: Open a ticket on ServiceNow
      correction: |
        That’s not right! You should choose a Conference whenever your event is longer than a couple of days and/or
        has parallel sessions.

        What is a "track" in Indico?
      items:
        - text: A theme or subject matter which is part of an Indico Conference programme and which can be used to
                classify abstracts
          correct: true
        - text: A level of approval of an abstract
        - text: A song which will play whenever you submit an abstract
      correction: |
        That’s not right! Tracks represent the subject matter of the Conference.
    - body: |
        Who decides when abstracts can be submitted?
      items:
        - text: Myself, abstracts are submitted by email
        - text: The event manager, who sets the opening date
          correct: true
        - text: No one. It's a random process.
      correction: |
        That’s not right! Abstract submission is enabled by the event manager, who sets the opening date.
        Once submission is open, abstracts are submitted through Indico.
    - body: |
        How do I know whether my Abstract was successfully submitted?
      num_selections: 2
      items:
        - text: I can see it from the Indico event
          correct: true
        - text: I won't know till 4 weeks before the conference
          correct: false
        - text: I will get a notification via e-mail
          correct: true
      correction: |
        That’s not right! When an abstract is successfully submitted the submitter will be informed by email. They can
        also check the submission status from the Indico event.

        My conference is free-of-charge. Do I need to configure payment anyway?
      items:
        - text: "Yes"
        - text: "No"
          correct: true
      correction: |
        That’s not right! Payment configuration is actually optional.
    - body: |
        How do I control who can register at my conference?
      items:
        - text: There's no way to do that
        - text: Only people from CERN can register at conferences
        - text: I can set the registration form as <em>Moderated</em>
          correct: true
        - text: I should expect an e-mail in addition to online registration
      correction: |
        That’s not right! Setting the registration form to <em>Moderated</em> will allow the manager has to approve
        all registrations beforehand
    - body: |
        How can you invite selected participants to an upcoming event?
      items:
        - text: I have to advertise the event on a Facebook group
        - text: There is an invitation workflow in Indico, which I can use to invite people
          correct: true
        - text: I should e-mail the whole CERN with an invitation
      correction: |
        That's not correct. Indico has an "invitation" workflow which allow participants to be invited on an individual
        basis
Room Booking:

  quiz:
    - body: Can I book the same room for a whole year?
      items:
          - text: |
              In principle, yes, but you will be prompted to cancel individual reservation occurrences if you
              don't actually use it
            correct: true
          - text: |
              No, there's a clear lack of meeting rooms at CERN, so booking rooms for more than 1 week is forbidden
          - text: Only if the room has no owner
      correction: |
        That's not right. Rooms can be booked for long periods, but you will get a notification to cancel individual
        occurrences in case you don't use it. You should be mindful of the usage of meeting rooms, however.
    - body: I absolutely need a given room, which is taken. Can I override the other person's booking?
      items:
        - text: Yes, as long as I am their (direct or indirect) supervisor
        - text: Yes, as long as I'm in a higher career grade
        - text:
            No, you have to "negotiate" with the person offline and ask them to cancel their booking
          correct: true
        - text: No, once a room is booked, there's no way back
      correction: |
        That's not right! Bookings can be canceled by their owner and by the managers of the room. You will have to
        "negotiate" with them offline, however.

      items:
        - text: "Yes"
        - text: "No"
          correct: true
      correction: That's incorrect. Surveys can only exist in the context of an event.
    - body: Which of those are survey field types which Indico offers?
      num_selections: 3
      items:
        - text: Number Input
          correct: true
        - text: Text Input

        - text: Passport Scan
        - text: Social media handle
        - text: Multiple selection

        - text: Make the request under the <em>Services &rarr; Logistics</em> tab
          correct: true
        - text: Send an e-mail to the recording service
      correction: |
        That's not right! You need to use Indico in order to make a recording request.
    - body: I asked for recording but the link to the video never showed up on my event page. Why?
      items:
        - text: I forgot to make the event fully public.
        - text: Someone must have forgotten to sign the <em>Speaker Release Form</em>
          correct: true
      correction: |
        That's not right. In order to have you recording published, you need first to have the consent of all
        speakers. Double-check that they all signed their release forms.
