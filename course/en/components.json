open for submissions, at a given future date, or right now.</p>\n<p>Before opening the Call for Abstracts, you have to define the parameters below.</p>\n<h3>Email notifications</h3>\n<p>To customise the email notification templates to send to the users who submit their abstracts, click on <em>Notifications</em>, and click on <em>Add new one</em>. Here you can add what we call a \"notification ruleset\", i.e. a specific email template to send when a rule is matched. For example: if an abstract is submitted, a certain email notification will be sent.</p>\n<p>Choose a <em>Title</em> for your ruleset, and select the email template that you want, for example “Submit”.
